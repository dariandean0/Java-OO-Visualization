# Java-OO-Visualization

## About:

This tool will help students in early Java courses understand 
concepts of classes and objects to bridge the gap between abstract concepts and concrete 
understanding by animating the process of object instantiation, reference assignment, and 
results of method invocation in a step-by-step way utilizing memory diagrams.
